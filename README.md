# AirBnb-Paris-Listings-Analysis

Overview:

This project analyzes Airbnb listings data for 10 major cities, focusing on Paris. The dataset includes over 250,000 listings and approximately 5 million guest reviews. The analysis aims to profile and quality assure the data, prepare it for visualization, and draw insights from the visualizations.

Objectives:

Objective 1: Profile & QA the Data

.Import/Open the Listings.csv file
.Cast date columns as datetime format
.Filter data to only include Paris listings
.Quality assurance of Paris listings data
.Check for missing values
.Calculate minimum, maximum, and average for numeric fields

Objective 2: Prepare the Data for Visualization

.Group Paris listings by 'neighbourhood' and calculate the mean price
.Identify the most expensive neighborhood and group by 'accommodates'
.Group data by 'host_since' year and calculate the average price and count of new hosts

Objective 3: Visualize the Data and Summarize Findings

.Create a horizontal bar chart of the average price by neighborhood
.Create a horizontal bar chart of the average price by 'accommodates' in the most expensive neighborhood
.Create line charts showing the count of new hosts and average price over time
.Analyze the impact of 2015 regulations on new hosts and prices
.Bonus: Create a dual-axis line chart showing both new hosts and average price over time

Findings and Conclusions:

.Impact of 2015 Regulations: Analysis suggests that the 2015 regulations led to a reduction in the number of new hosts and an increase in average prices. This indicates that the regulations may have made it more challenging for new hosts to enter the market, thereby reducing supply and driving up prices.

.Neighborhood Insights: The average price for Airbnb listings varies significantly across different neighborhoods in Paris, with Elysee being the most expensive.

.Accommodation Capacity: The price also varies with the accommodation capacity, with larger accommodations (e.g., for 12-16 people) commanding much higher prices.
